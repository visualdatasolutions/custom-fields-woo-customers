== Description ==

Sometime you or your clients may hope to keep extra information about customers to provide better personalised service. The extra information is usually stored as custom fields. 

CIO Custom Fields for Woo Customers enables you to add custom fields at customer registration, checkout, backend user profile and frontend edit account pages, without touching a single line of code.

When activated, CIO Custom Fields for Woo Customers creates some custom fields (billing and shipping addresses) and stores data in a format to share with PODS. You may use PODS graphical user interface to configure the custom fields. Once configuration is finished, PODS can be safely deactivated. CIO Custom Fields for Woo Customers does not need PODS to run.

CIO Custom Fields for Woo Customers integrates with CIO Custom Fields Importer for data import.
